# Welcome to the Admin Scripts Repo!

Here you will find a variety of Bash, Powershell and Python script examples that can be utilized as a jumping off point for creating your own automation scripts to be used with the [Bitwarden CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/) and/or [APIs](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-apis/). 

***Important things to note:***
- Admin Scripts are currently divided into separate folders by type: _API Scripts, Bash, Powershell, and Python_
- Admin scripts are meant to act as ***examples***. They are not written in a way that can be run as is and so will require at least some modifications/insertions
- Most scripts contain commented instructions, so please read through thoroughly/carefully
